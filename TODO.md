# TODO list

- Check if names are unique, this is important for funannotate compare and probably also relevant in general.
- add genome summary script as alternative to funannotate compare
- add option to run with Docker or Singularity 
- Clean data.csv file (some fields are redundant)
- add check when --setup is run again.


- perhaps it would be better to change the structure of the repo so that when cloned you already get the basic directories in data/ (assemblies, external, etc.), rather than have these in .gitignore, have .gitignore in the directories that ignores all in the respective directory
